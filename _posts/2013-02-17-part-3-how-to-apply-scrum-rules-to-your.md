This is the third part of a story "how to apply the Scrum rules to your school project".<br />
<br />
<h2>tl;dr</h2>This time we’ll cover the Sprint, the Daily, the Review and the Retrospective. The next part will be about the Artifacts and a good practice.<br />

<br />
<h2>The Sprint</h2>When you get your backlog done you may want to start something called the sprint. The Sprint is a fixed length work time. There are some simple rules for the sprint. The most basic rule is to have a unchangeable task list for the sprint. You get the list of TODOs and you start working on every single line of it. I prefer shorter sprints. A week seems to be the best option out there. Fail often, fail early as they says.<br />
<br />
<h2>The Daily</h2>The daily is one day in a sprint. You pick the task. You focus on it. You solve it. It is that simple :} If you work in a team you should pick one fixed time of the day for a very short stand-up meeting. For example at 11:00 am every day at the exact same location we would meet in order to talk about our problems in that particular day.<br />
<br />
<h2>The Review</h2>This is a part where you show your teacher what you’ve done since last week. This part is crucial to the whole process. Many of you may be asking why to show your project so often. The answer is quite straight forward. As soon as your teacher sees it he or she may give you feedback. If you get evaluation on a very early stage of the implementation the change would require less time and resources. If you show your work after a few months they may be not satisfied of your overall performance and grade you poorly. If you work with them (even 15 minutes a week) they may feel, that they shaped your project and you’ve made it exactly as they wanted to have it done. In the end we’re all humans and the rules applie to all of us. We want to be noticed and we want to feel important. Give them the notion of importance.<br />
<br />
<h2>The Retrospective</h2>This is my favorite part. It shouldn't take to long. Ask yourself what errors have you made in the sprint. What problems you struggled with? Were there any obstacles? What was the bottle neck or single point of failure? Have I done everything right as it was in my backlog? Have I estimated tasks with perfect accuracy? Have I overestimated/underestimated? Learn from your mistakes. This is the most important thing at all!
