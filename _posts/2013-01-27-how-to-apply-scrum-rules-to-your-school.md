This article does NOT only apply to Software Development and IT! You may be using Scrum process in every project in your school. It doesn't matter whether you have: presentations, end year projects or even prom planning. This is the best thing about it. Go on. Try this out. Verify if it applies in your situation. Every rule in any of the following notes could be applied either to a team or a single person.<br />
<br />
<h2>tl;dr</h2>This is the first part of the story. The project team (as long as you are doing this project with your friends) should have three distinct roles. Product Owner, Scrum Master and the most common one the Developer. We will cover here all of these roles in Scrum. How they reflect on your school project team. The next entry will be about the Product Backlog, Grooming, Planning and Estimation process.<br />
<br />
By the way. Do you know that the Scrum name is taken from rugby formation?<br />

<br />
<h2>Product Owner</h2>This role is a representation of a business client in your project. In almost every possible case at the university this role would be professor’s. Product Owner should maintain (and with help of the development team members) order in the backlog. The most important thing about Product Owner is that he or she should be fully decisive in the name of the client.<br />
<br />
<h2>Scrum Master</h2>This is a role for a referee. The Scrum Master helps other developers to play by the book. He/she should know how Scrum works and how to solve problems during the sprint. In most cases it would be handling people’s everyday problems. Missed deadlines, absences and few other very common issues. I will cover those problems in a separate blogpost in the future.<br />
<br />
<h2>Developer</h2>Every other person in the Scrum team is a developer. Everyone is responsible for failure or success of the sprint. There is no distinction for testers, admins and programmers. The Scrum team should be interdisciplinary. Everyone should be able to cover for each other. The things that you’ve promised to deliver at the sprint should be immune to the absence of any team member. There should be no single point of failure and/or bottle necks. This is a very important rule.<br />
<br />
<h2>Stakeholders and Users</h2>There are two more roles in the Scrum. Stakeholder and User. Stakeholder is a person who has an interest in the project. User is a person who will be using your product after the release.<br />

<br />
There are several ways to choose among your colleagues who will be who in this project. Here are some important recommendations. One of the most common is to never put as Scrum Master a person who is a Product Owner. In many cases those two roles conflict with each other. Scrum Master represents the interest of a team, hence Product Owner states for the client and his/her requirements.
