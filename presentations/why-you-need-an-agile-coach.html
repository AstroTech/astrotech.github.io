# Why You Need an Agile Coach


## Why, oh why?
- we can do it on our own
- we will teach our guys
- it would be cheaper


## Who am I?
- Technical person (still programming for fun)
- Eating my own dog food
- Lead around 50 teams
- I lead Corporations, Governments, Startups
- I brought agile to gov.pl


## Why you don't want me
- hourly rate
- outsider


## What do you do
- invest time
- invest money
- put a lot of effort


## Outcome
- waste of money
    - Developer time is expensive... and don't want to be an expert in agility... he wants to code!
- long time
    - Changing people is hard and time consuming
- Agile is not working for us


## What you missed
- Possibility to earn more by doing the stuff you know and like
- Possibility to learn more programming skills


## Why don't you...
- Write your own CMS?
- Write your own CRM?
- Write your own ERP?
- Write your own Issue Tracker?


## How the cooperation looks like
- SPM meetings
- how often?
- how long?
- technical help with CI/CD and coding
