<blockquote><h2>Product Owner Checklist</h2><br />
This brief checklist helps you remember the most important things to become a good Product Owner.<br />
<br />
As the Product Owner you are responsible for maximizing the value of the product and the work of the Development Team. Your way of doing this may vary across organizations, Scrum Teams, and individuals. This checklist is therefore only an example.<br />
<br />
Even the best Product Owners cannot know beforehand what is most valuable for the customers, end users, and investors. Thankfully, Scrumâ€™s inspection and adaptation cycle provides feedback and learning opportunities also for you as the Product Owner. To monitor your personal growth, you can occasionally re-check your Product Owner Score.<br />
