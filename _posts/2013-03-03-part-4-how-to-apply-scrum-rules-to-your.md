<br />
<h2>tl;dr</h2>This time we’ll cover some Scrum artifacts.<br />

<br />
<h2>Product Backlog</h2>I wrote about the Product Backlog in the first part of the story. In short: Product Backlog is a TODO list for the whole project. Every single task that sooner or later should be done has a place here.<br />
<br />
<h2>Sprint Backlog</h2>This is one of the most important thing in a Scrum process. This is a TODO list for the next sprint. The tasks are selected among Product Backlog entries.<br />
<br />
<h2>Estimation and Story Points</h2>Estimation takes place in the planning session. What you have to do is to put points to every single task in your backlog. How hard or how long it takes to do this task. This points will be your so called Story Points. Definition states, that the Story Points are the point value of how a problem is hard and the scale of SP should be well known to each member of the team.<br />
<br />
There is no simple scale. Currently I prefer to use a Fibonacci series (1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21 and<br />
<br />
?) where question mark states that the task needs to be groomed all over once again. Often you may see a variation with slightly different values, because Fibonacci series card and points are copyrighted.<br />

<br />
The points shouldn’t be one to one related with hours. This is a simplification which is made by an inexperienced team. At the beginning you may think that this is a good idea. Sooner or later you will realize that the Story Points don’t reflect your overall performance on the subject in a given period. They are a constant value of how many hours you spend on a project. In real life work conditions this reflects to a 40 hour long work week. Velocity chart won’t give you information about an improvement in your speed or progress. It will state that this week you’ve done a bit more or less than the desired 40 hours.<br />
<br />
<h2>To be continued...</h2>Next time we will cover: Business Value, Daily meeting, Velocity Chart, Burndown Chart and finally a Scrum good practice.
