I've talked how C++ was a Testosterone languageâ€¦<br />
I've talked how Java was kind of an Estrogen language...<br />
<br />
Smaltalk was fairly non hormonal.<br />
It didn't have this manly or incipit kind of feel.<br />
Smaltak was more related to caffeine.<br />
You could get a lot done in Smaltalk.<br />
Maybe we should relate it to Oxytocin.<br />
It caused the labour to be stimulated :}<br />
