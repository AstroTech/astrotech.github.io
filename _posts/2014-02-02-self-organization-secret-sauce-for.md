High performance depends on the self-organizing capability of teams. Understanding how this works and how to avoid destroying self-organization is a challenge. Until you understand complex adaptive systems and how Toyota works it is difficult to improve team velocity. Jeff will discuss three core topics:<br />
<br />
1. Shock therapy as a strategy for booting up teams.<br />
2. The Cosmic Stopping Problem, otherwise known as the choice uncertainty principle.<br />
3. Punctuated equilibrium - how software systems evolve<br />
<br />
Take advantage of these concepts and you may find a way to achieve the ultimate potential of a team. This session will be a "Deep Agile" presentation keying off topics presented to engineers at MIT.<br />
<br />
Speaker: Jeff Sutherland<br />
Dr. Jeff Sutherland is one of the co-creators of the Scrum software development process. He and Ken Schwaber invented Scrum in 1993. Since then he has worked with many software companies and IT organizations to extend and enhance this process.<br />
