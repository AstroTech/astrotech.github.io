Every once a while I try to imagine how my life would look like if only I had chosen different path than IT. I have met many friendly people related to computers in my life so far. There is no way back from the point where I am standing right now. I’ve got used to the IT jokes and do I understand them... Therefore I am a geek. Isn’t that something worthwhile spending time on pondering? Hmm... let’s see.<br />

<h2>Every story has the beginning...</h2>My journey started on February 28th, 1999. I had plenty possibilities to use computers before, however I have started to count my everlasting love for these machines since that particular day. The day when I’ve got my first computer! Everything has changed since then.<br />
<br />
For the next few years I have been amazed by this little gray box. I had spend a lot of time on gaming, changing wallpapers and tweaking the system which eventually resulted in crashing the whole Windows 98 :} Long story short, I had found a new passion which has deeply settled in my heart ever since.<br />
<br />
<h2>Learing...</h2>I’ve met plenty of nice people who helped me to gain experience and to extend my skills in other IT related areas to the point where I am right now. I have spent countless nights in front of IRC channels. Asking my own and responding to those of others. And I am very grateful for the help given to me by this great number of souls.<br />
<br />
Indeed. There was one one day in my life (a few years after I have got my PC) when I decided to go social to the Linux User Group. By the way, someday I will write my story about "How I started using  Linux" which is kind of a nice story though. As far as I remember it was a Mandrake 9.1 with 2.4.12-pre kernel... A long time ago :}<br />
<br />
But getting straight to the point. It was a Poznan Poland Linux User Group (A.K.A PPLUG). On that particular day I met tons of Linux and IT fanatics and passionates. I have found similar nerds, passionate about what they are doing on daily basis. At last. I am not the only freak out there! I was 16 back then and I was a young kid but I wanted to dive deep into it or should I write "dive deep into IT" :}<br />
<br />
<h2>Give yourself away...</h2>So many people have helped me so far. I will pass it on!<br />
<br />
From now on, I am starting a new blog for those youngsters, teenagers and students passionate about IT like I was... like continuously I am!<br />
<br />
I’ll help you like others helped me. I’ll do my best.<br />
<br />
Do not lose the passion!<br />
Do not lose the will!<br />
<br />
This is the most important thing!<br />
The rest is only a matter of the time.<br />
<br />
Stay tuned.<br />
Matt
